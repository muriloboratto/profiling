    "The first of all is to understand the meaning of the **asynchronous memory prefetching** technique. A powerful technique to reduce the overhead of page faulting and on-demand memory migrations, both in host-to-device and device-to-host memory transfers, is called **asynchronous memory prefetching**. Using this technique allows programmers to asynchronously migrate unified memory (UM) to any CPU or GPU device in the system, in the background, prior to its use by application code. By doing this, GPU kernels and CPU function performance can be increased on account of reduced page fault and on-demand data migration overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prefetching also tends to migrate data in larger chunks, and therefore fewer trips, than on-demand migration. This makes it an excellent fit when data access needs are known before runtime, and when data access patterns are not sparse.\n",
    "\n",
    "CUDA makes asynchronously prefetching managed memory to either a GPU device or the CPU easy with its `cudaMemPrefetchAsync` function. Here is an example of using it to both prefetch data to the currently active GPU device, and then, to the CPU:\n",
