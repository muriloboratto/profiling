# Performance Analysis Profiling on CPU and GPU cores <br/>

This repository contains the material corresponding to the webinar/Hands-on: _Performance Analysis Profiling on CPU and GPU cores_ organized by HPC/CIMATEC. The objectives are:

1. **Present** quickly and objectively concepts of Profiling;
2. **Show** through simple examples the use of performance analysis tool on multiprocessador and multi-GPU;
3. **Expose** students to applicability in case studies.

Material available in \*.ipynb (Jupyter NoteBook) format. There are 3 notebooks in this repository:

## [01-Command-Line-Performance-Analysis-Tool.ipynb]
The introductory notebook contains some of the webinar's content, and through some basic commands, we will be able to characterize the introduce the profiling in supercomputing environments.

## [02-Visual-Performance-Analysis-Tool.ipynb]
This notebook will introduce the profiling on visual tool.

## [03-Final-Exercise.ipynb]
In this notebook, we will propose a final exercise for a case study.
